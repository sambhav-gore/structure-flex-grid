#### Attribution

Structure flex grid is inspired from [Dress Code](https://github.com/zalando/dress-code/). 
I made Structure as I wanted only the grid without the overhead of all other styles and something which could be easily 
combined other libraries such as Angular-Material (as I find the grid in material library very confusing).

In addition, watch this space for more modular libraries in future which would contribute towards making the `Structure Framework`.
